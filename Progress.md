- **Mesh network:** DHCP assignment working (192.168.50.x subnet)

### Issues Encountered & Troubleshooting Process:

#### Issue 1: Interface Naming Instability
**Problem:** USB ethernet adapter interface name changed between connections
- Initial: `enx[MAC-BASED-ID-1]`
- After reconnection: `enx[MAC-BASED-ID-2]`
- **Impact:** Static bridge configuration referenced non-existent interface

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. `lsusb | grep -i ethernet` - Confirmed adapter detection
2. `ip link show` - Identified actual interface name
3. `ip addr show` - Verified IP assignment but interface DOWN state
4. `ip link set enx[MAC-BASED-ID-2] up` - Manually brought interface up

#### Issue 2: Network Connectivity Failure
**Problem:** Ping failures and web interface inaccessible despite correct IP configuration
- Both devices on same subnet (192.168.50.x)
- Intermittent ping responses (50% packet loss, then 0%, then total failure)
- Web service confirmed running locally via `curl -k https://localhost:8006`

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. **Firewall Investigation:**
   - `systemctl status pveproxy` - Confirmed web service running
   - `systemctl stop pve-firewall` - Eliminated firewall as cause
   - `ss -tulpn | grep 8006` - Verified port 8006 listening

2. **Bridge Configuration Analysis:**
   - `brctl show vmbr0` - Checked bridge membership  
   - `ip route show` - Verified routing table
   - Bridge had correct IP but physical interface wasn't properly joined

3. **Bidirectional Connectivity Tests:**
   - Laptop → Proxmox: Intermittent ping responses
   - Proxmox → Laptop: Total failure (destination unreachable)
   - Indicates asymmetric routing or bridge forwarding issue

#### Issue 3: Configuration Complexity
**Root Cause:** Network configured without ethernet adapter present during initial Proxmox installation
- WiFi installation impossible (confirmed limitation)
- Bridge-to-interface mapping misconfigured
